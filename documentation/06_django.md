# Django

Django was chosen very late in the project lifecycle. Literally two weeks before the project was due,
in order to have an admin page for the clients and make future development easier.

Flask is great but it requires so much work while Django already comes with what you need. Win win.

There is nothing out of the ordinary here. The mail backend has been switched to use SendGrid and the API key 
is in the settings file. There are some tests written but there was not enough time to convert all of the Flask ones
to Django.
