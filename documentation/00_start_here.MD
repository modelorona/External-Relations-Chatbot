# The External Relations ChatBot

## by SE(0)07

This documentation folder aims to explain everything in this project. This includes the 
entire app architecture as well as technologies used and how they fit together.

It also lists other external services used and for what purpose.

It will then talk about current issues that are present within the application that could
not be fixed due to time issues.

This folder however will not include instructions on how to set up everything. That can be done
by going into the respective folders (```client```, ```firebase```, and ```server```).

The ```deploy``` folder contains scripts for deployment through the Gitlab but these are 
out of date as there were many problems with Gitlab being down and the runners not working properly.
The team chose not to deploy automatically but to only use the pipeline for testing.
